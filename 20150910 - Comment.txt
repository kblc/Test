-- Did not solve the task! Calculations are wrong.
-- Did not solve the task! There are no tests. 
++ Code is efficient in terms of speed
-  made assumptions about the problem domain without making sure they are correct
-  over-complicating with LinQ, code is not maintainable

Legend:
++ Very Positive
+ Positive
+- Neutral
- Negative
-- Very negative/Not acceptable

Summing up 
d2 would need to implement the correct calculation and of course would need to test it properly. 
Seeing the very LINQ-heavy code, there is a chance that the good performance is simply by chance.
So I would like to see the implementation of FetchData with minimal usage of LINQ (e.g. no joins).

Can you tell me more about test task "Mean rate of a patient's growth per each doctor"? 
Current implementation is "Mean rate of a patient's growth per measurement per each doctor". 
Did you mean "Mean rate of a patient's growth per day/month/year per each doctor" or something else?

I don't understand "Mean rate of a patient's growth per measurement per each doctor" as he states. 
A patient cannot grow during one measurement. The problem with these kind of statements is that they are 
always open to some kind of interpretation. I would like to set some more context to the task and describe 
the "Mean rate of a patient's growth per each doctor"

Please keep in mind that this is still a test task so there is no real use case for this kind of calculation.
Imagine there exists a clinical trial who is testing a new medicine designed to help persons with a hormonal 
disorder which prevents them from growing normally as a teenager. A total of 50 specialized hospitals all over
the world are selected to each recruit around 50 patients and test the new drug on them. Patients (mainly teenagers)
will be treated with the medicine and will be followed up every month over a period of 5 years. On every visit 
(so every month) the height will be measured of the subjects and the primary outcome of the clinical trial is the
weekly growth rate.
Our system designed to access the data set of the sponsor (the pharma company conducting the trial) and check the
data for plausibility, fraud or quality issues. For this we derive a lot of new metrics from the existing data.
One of this metrics is the average growth rate of a site. How much did each patient grow per week on average for 
each doctor/site.
The calculated value will be used for several risk assessments later in the pipeline. 
I hope that this scenario is helping you.
